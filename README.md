# HNSW C++ Implementation

This is a CPP implementation of the HNSW paper. I wrote it for use with my semantic search PDF app repo. The select neighbors implemented is the simple version.

## Overview

This implementation compares **Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) search** with a **brute-force linear search**. The main function:
- Generates **1000 random 384-dimensional embeddings**.
- Inserts them into **HNSW** and **performs K-NN searches**.
- Runs a **linear search** to find exact nearest neighbors.
- Compares results in terms of **speed and accuracy**.

At **1000 embeddings**, HNSW provides **~3x faster search time** than brute-force search, but **construction time is significantly longer**. This is a **tradeoff between indexing time and recall**, but for my use case, I prefer greater indexing time to optimize search speed.

## Future Improvements
I intend to add **concurrent insertion** in a future version if possible, to improve indexing speed without sacrificing search efficiency.
